The examples and InitialConditionSolvers are shown here.


My own example is in the dictionary ./ScalarFieldnexttoPBH, which is trying to describe such a system:


A universe with a Schwarszchild Black Hole and a cosmological constant, the latter of which is provided 
by the false vaccum potential V_{False}>0 of a scalar field. A true vacuum scalar bubble with V_{True}=0
is generated by quantum flactuations, and is initally far away from the black hole.


As the system evolves, the bubble expands and finally swallow the black hole, which may lead to the following
two possible phenomena. Firstly, the black hole suffers a "phase transition" from a dS-Schwarzschild black
hole to a Schwarzschild black hole. Secondely, the black hole may absorb some kinetic energy of the 
scalar field.
